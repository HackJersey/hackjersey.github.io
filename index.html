<h1>Hack Jersey</h1>
<p>We're a group that brings programmers and journalists together in New Jersey to learn from each other. We create innovative, open source news projects in an effort to improve the quantity and quality of public data and the journalism that depends on it.</p>

<h2>Boundary Service out of commission</h2>

<p>This boundary service is no longer supported. It would need a bit of TLC to get the Django code updated to a currently maintained version of the framework. If you'd like to help with this effort, please reach out to us in the <a href="https://github.com/HackJersey/nj-boundaryservice/issues">Github issues</a> for this project.</p>
